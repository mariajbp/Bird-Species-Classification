### :bird: Soft Computing class project 

Classification of bird species that appear on an image based on the use of a Convolutional Neural Network model (CNN)

#### Dataset features: 
- Bird Species: 250;
- Training Images: 35215 (not balanced, however has at least 100 training image files per
species);
- Validation Images: 1250 (5 per species);
- Test Images: 1250 (5 per species);
- Images Size: 224 x 224 x 3 color channels in jpg format;
- Species gender: 80% of total images are of male while the remaining 20% are of female

#### ML models developped: 
- <b> CNN </b> + Search of optimal parameters using a <b> Genetic algorithm </b> + <b> Data Augmentation </b> techniques
- <b> VGG16
- VGG19
